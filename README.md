# smco
A Simple Monte Carlo Optimizer using Adaptive Coordinate Sampling
Juan David Velasquez around 2011. It was archived from CRAN in 2022
because requests for corrections to the package structure were ignored.

This version is supplied by John Nash to allow the use of the smco
approach in the gloptim wrapper for global/stochastic optimization.
